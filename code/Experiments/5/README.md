# Note
There's is a total of three runs on the training split (default). 
- The 30 epoch run was a mistake and was ran with wrong weight for the decoder head loss functions
- The 10 epoch run is... Well the first 10 epochs :) 
- The 20 epoch run is a continuation of the 10 epoch run to hit a total of 30 epochs of training
